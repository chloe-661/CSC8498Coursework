`You have attempted to style the beginning of your website using the specification below but it is not looking correct. There must be some errors in your code. Try to find them all, then note down the line number and the correction. 
For example, on line 1, body is spelt wrong. So you would input [1, body] into the answer boxes. You don't need to repeat this one.
Specification:
- The body should fill the entire page with no gaps at the sides and the background colour should be white with the font Arial for any text
- The header should be grey and should fill the entire width of the page. There should be 10px of padding on all sides. All text should be 16px in size, aligned to the left, and white.
- The footer should be fixed to the bottom of the page and fill the entire width of the page. All text should be green and centered. There should be 10px of padding on all sides`;
